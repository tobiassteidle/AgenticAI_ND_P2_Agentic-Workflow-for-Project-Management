Explanation of the evaluation agent's response:
The Evaluation Agent checks the response of the Knowledge Augmented Prompt Agent against the evaluation criteria.
In this case, the evaluation criteria state that the answer should be solely the name of a city, not a sentence.
The Evaluation Agent will assess whether the Knowledge Agent's response meets this criterion.
The Evaluation Agent's response will indicate whether the Knowledge Agent's answer is acceptable or not based on the evaluation criteria.
