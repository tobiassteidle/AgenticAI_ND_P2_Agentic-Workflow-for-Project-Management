Defining workflow steps from the workflow prompt

Executing step: The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down the user stories into smaller, actionable tasks that can be completed by the development team. These tasks may include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) to ensure successful implementation of the product features.
